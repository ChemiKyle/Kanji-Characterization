## Kanji Characterization

As a lover of science fiction, I often come across characters from other
languages, typically Japanese in '80's cyberpunk or Chinese in more modern works
like *The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories*. Having fostered an interest in
machine learning - with its many examples of Latin alphabet recognition - I
wondered if I could train a neural net to classify if a character is Hanzi,
Hangul, or Kanji.
